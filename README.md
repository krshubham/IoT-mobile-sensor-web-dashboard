# IoT-mobile-sensor-web-dashboard
The web dashboard that displays the sensor data for user activity from a firebase database.

The application connects to a running instance of firebase real time database. The companion mobile app keeps on running
on the mobile app and writes in the cloud database. A listener in the web dashboard receives the changes and then makes the
visualizations appear in Real Time.
